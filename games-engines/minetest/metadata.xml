		Minetest is an infinite-world block sandbox game and a game engine,
		inspired by InfiniMiner, Minecraft and the like.

		Features:
		- Walk around, dig and build in an infinite voxel world (or boxel,
		as reddit calls it), and craft stuff from raw materials to help you
		along the way. We hope to add in some survival elements, but not
		much really exist ATM.
		- Sinfully easy server-side modding API.
		- Multiplayer support for tens of players, via servers hosted by
		users
		- Voxel based dynamic lighting (quite similar to Minecraft; light
		up caves with torches)
		- Almost infinite world and a fairly good map generator (limited
		to +-31000 blocks in all directions at the moment)
		- Runs natively on Windows and Linux (C++ and Irrlicht. No Java.)
